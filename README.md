# PopulationDensityMappingUsing_RProgramming

Welcome to the **PopulationDensityMappingUsing_RProgramming** repository! This project demonstrates how to analyze population density and visualize it on a map using **R programming**. The repository contains an RMarkdown (`.rmd`) file detailing the entire process, along with geopackage datasets for population and boundaries.

## üìä About This Repository

In this repository, I explore how to map population density using geospatial data and R programming. The process includes loading geospatial datasets, performing necessary transformations, calculating population density, and finally visualizing it on a map.

The core steps are documented in an RMarkdown file that guides you through the entire workflow. The datasets used include:

- **Population Dataset**: Contains population data for different regions.
- **Boundaries Dataset**: Contains geographic boundaries for regions (e.g., provinces, cities, etc.).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools and Technologies

This project uses the following tools and packages:

- **R Programming**: For performing the data analysis and mapping.
  - **`sf`**: For handling and analyzing geospatial data.
  - **`ggplot2`**: For creating the map visualizations.
  - **`leaflet`**: For creating interactive maps.
  - **`dplyr`**: For data manipulation.
  - **`tmap`**: For thematic mapping in R.
  - **`rgdal`**: For reading and writing spatial data.
  
- **Geospatial Data**: The datasets used are in the **Geopackage (.gpkg)** format.

## üìÅ Files in This Repository

### 1. **RMarkdown File**
- **`PopulationDensityMapping.Rmd`**: This RMarkdown file documents the entire process from data loading to map creation. It contains R code chunks and explanations for each step, making it a great resource for understanding the process of population density mapping.

### 2. **Geospatial Datasets**
- **`population_data.gpkg`**: Geospatial dataset containing population data for various regions.
- **`boundary_data.gpkg`**: Geospatial dataset containing boundaries of regions (e.g., administrative units).

## üó∫Ô∏è Visualization and Mapping

In this project, I calculate the population density for each region and visualize it on a map. The following visualizations are created:

- **Population Density Map**: A choropleth map displaying population density across regions.
- **Interactive Map**: An interactive map created using **leaflet** to explore the population density.
